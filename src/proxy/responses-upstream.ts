/**
 * ResponsesUpstream — UpstreamAdapter for OpenAI-compatible providers that
 * speak the native Responses API (`POST /responses`) rather than Chat
 * Completions.
 *
 * codex-proxy's internal request representation is already Responses-shaped,
 * so this adapter is near-passthrough: createResponse() forwards the request
 * (stripped of codex-proxy-internal routing fields) and parseStream() emits the
 * native Responses SSE events as-is — they are already in CodexSSEEvent shape.
 *
 * Opt-in per API key via `ApiKeyEntry.wire = "responses"`. Default stays
 * Chat Completions (OpenAIUpstream) because the common third-party providers
 * (DeepSeek / Kimi / GLM) only expose /chat/completions.

 * Build the upstream `/responses` body from the internal request, rewriting the
 * model to the provider-native id.
 *
 * This is an ALLOWLIST, not a denylist: only standard Responses API generation
 * fields are forwarded. Everything else is intentionally dropped so nothing
 * codex-proxy-internal ever leaks to an arbitrary third-party endpoint —
 * routing fields (useWebSocket / turnState / …), chatgpt.com-scoped state
 * (client_metadata), and the OpenAI-org-bound `include:
 * ["reasoning.encrypted_content"]` (most likely to be rejected by, or
 * meaningless to, a non-OpenAI provider; reasoning summaries still stream
 * without it).
 *
 * Known limitation: `previous_response_id` is dropped, so server-side
 * conversation continuation is not supported on third-party Responses backends.
 * codex-proxy keeps no session affinity for direct upstreams, and the id is a
 * chatgpt.com-scoped `resp_*` the third party cannot resolve (passing it through
 * would guarantee a 404). This matches the Chat Completions wire, which has no
 * continuation concept either.
 *
 * The forwarded set is exactly the generation-relevant fields that exist on the
 * Codex-shaped `CodexResponsesRequest`. Standard Responses controls that
 * codex-proxy never threads through its internal model (temperature, top_p,
 * max_output_tokens, stop, seed, response_format, …) are therefore not sent —
 * identical to the Chat Completions wire, which drops them too.
